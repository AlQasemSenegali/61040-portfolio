### The Three Domains I Feel Most Passionate About

- **Academic Pathfinding:**  
  When I first came to MIT, I felt lost among the endless interests one could explore, not to mention the many different ways to pursue those interests. Now, after three years, I’ve learned a lot about how I *could have* navigated things more effectively, and it pains me to see new students about to make the same mistakes I made. I believe a platform that connects people’s academic journeys and highlights different perspectives would enrich our community. It could help guide incoming students to explore their interests more effectively and avoid common pitfalls.

- **Faith Reflections:**  
  As a Muslim, religion is a central part of my life. It not only fulfills my spiritual needs, but also provides guiding principles for how to treat others, care for myself, and live meaningfully. I believe that even non-Muslims could find wisdom in some of Islam’s ideals and teachings—especially if they’re shared through real stories of how those teachings shape our daily lives. A platform for such reflections could spark understanding across different communities.

- **Self-Journaling:**  
  Recently, I stumbled upon a message I had written to myself a year earlier, and I was struck by how similar my thought process was to the present day. It made me realize how often we forget the reasoning behind past decisions, and how unfairly we sometimes judge those decisions only by their outcomes. I believe having a place to document the *why* behind our choices—the reasoning, the tradeoffs, the external factors—would help us reconnect with our past selves. It would also allow us to build on our thinking over time and refine it into better decision-making for the future.

## Problems

### Academic Pathfinding

- **Lack of Direction Guiding:** Many students (especially incoming ones) have interests in solving certain life problems or enjoyed specific activities like building robots, but they don’t know what academic directions in university correspond to those interests.  

- **Unclear/Too-Open Academic Tracks:** For some degrees or scientific fields in universities, it is not always clear what the best set of courses, experiences, or resources are to build knowledge and prepare for a career. Tracks in majors can feel vague, overly general, or too broad in their options. 

- **Overlooked Academic Fields:** Some research areas or jobs are much less popular than others, not necessarily because of career opportunities or pay. Less popular fields often remain unheard of because there is little blogging or sharing of work in those areas.  


### Faith Reflections

- **Limited awareness of Islam’s everyday teachings:** Many people view Islam mainly through practices like prayer and fasting, but the faith also has teachings that touch all aspects of life, from health to social interaction. These broader principles are less well known, especially among non-Muslims.  

- **Underrepresentation of Muslims in casual media:** Islam is widely known, but it is not reflected in everyday media as much as other affiliations or identities. This lack of casual representation can contribute to tension and misunderstandings about the faith.  

- **Difficulty sharing personal faith experiences:** Many Muslims would like to share how religious teachings shape their everyday lives, but often lack a comfortable and open space to do so without fear of judgment or misinterpretation.  


### Self-Journaling

- **Disconnection from Past Selves:** Many people feel disconnected from who they were in the past. While everyone matures over time, core parts of us often remain the same. We tend to forget this continuity because we judge our past selves mainly by the poor outcomes of past actions. 

- **Incomplete Reflections:** Some people struggle to reflect meaningfully on past decisions or events, finding themselves stuck in loops. This often happens when there is no record of the full thought process at the time, leaving only an incomplete picture to draw insights from. 

- **Fading Memories:** With time, memories of events may be forgotten or dismissed as unimportant. While some details truly may not matter, others give important depth to situations and can influence how we understand and learn from them.  


### Selected Problems

- **Unclear/Too-Open Academic Tracks (Academic Pathfinding):**  
  This issue not only leaves students feeling lost when navigating their degrees, but can also cause them to lose interest in their passions when they don’t find a clear, effective path forward. Advising resources at universities can be helpful, but often lack first-hand insights from students and may be outdated. A more organized platform that combines upperclassmen experiences with faculty vetting could give students the best of both worlds.

- **Difficulty Sharing Personal Faith Experiences (Faith Reflections):**  
  To foster an environment of understanding and respect, people should feel able to share their personal identities and principles, and how these shape everyday practices. Many Muslims face difficulty in expressing these experiences. Encouraging and facilitating such sharing could help build confidence, representation, and empathy across communities.

- **Incomplete Reflections (Self-Journaling):**  
  Self-reflection is a crucial part of personal growth, but without details and reasoning behind past actions, many potential lessons are lost. Documentation can help, but open-ended journaling often becomes overwhelming or disorganized, making it difficult to revisit productively. A more structured, decision-focused way of journaling could make reflection more effective and engaging.

### Excluded Problems

- **Lack of Direction Guiding (Academic Pathfinding):**  
  This could be better addressed by improving how advisors work with students, especially by encouraging them to listen more deeply to student stories, rather than through a software-based solution.

- **Overlooked Academic Fields (Academic Pathfinding):**  
  While important, this problem would require gathering detailed information from busy professors and researchers, creating too much friction for the scope of this project.

- **Limited Awareness of Islam’s Everyday Teachings (Faith Reflections):**  
  Although these teachings are valuable, learning them directly from lived experiences could lead to inaccuracies. Such content is better sourced from trusted scholars and official materials.

- **Underrepresentation of Muslims in Casual Media (Faith Reflections):**  
  Addressing this gap would require broad, large-scale cultural shifts and media involvement, which goes beyond the scope of a class project.

- **Disconnection from Past Selves (Self-Journaling):**  
  While meaningful, this problem feels more complex and may require professional guidance rather than a student project.

- **Fading Memories (Self-Journaling):**  
  Forgetting can sometimes be healthy and protective. A solution that only targets negative forgetting would be difficult to define and may unintentionally interfere with natural coping processes.



## Stakeholders

### Unclear/Too-Open Academic Tracks (Academic Pathfinding)
- **Students** (someone who tries to navigate their academic interests through classes)  
- **University Advisors** (someone who tries to better guide students to achieve their academic goals)  
- **Researchers** (someone who would like to offer working opportunities to students with strong background)  

**Impacts:** Students are affected directly by the vagueness in this field, caused to feel lost or waste their time with poor choices. Advisors are also sometimes suffering from lack of knowledge about how to tackle some interests, not being able to help their advisees. For researchers, sometimes they'd need more training time on average even when there are classes and open resources available to students, so researchers need to fill the gaps caused by these resources not being known.  

---

### Difficulty Sharing Personal Faith Experiences (Faith Reflections)
- **Muslim Students** (someone who wants to share their experiences but struggles to find a safe, casual space)  
- **Peers/Non-Muslim Students** (someone who could gain understanding and empathy through exposure to faith-based reflections)  
- **Campus Cultural/Religious Organizations** (groups that try to foster inclusion and provide a platform for expression)  

**Impacts:** Muslim students may feel isolated or unable to fully express an important part of their identity. Their peers may miss opportunities to gain insight and build mutual respect through hearing about lived experiences. Campus organizations may struggle to create a culture of open dialogue if individuals don’t feel comfortable contributing.  

---

### Incomplete Reflections (Self-Journaling)
- **Individuals** (someone trying to reflect on past choices and growth more effectively)  
- **Mental Health Professionals** (therapists or counselors who could use structured reflections to support their clients)  
- **Future Self** (the person looking back on past records to learn and make better decisions)  

**Impacts:** Individuals are affected when their reflections feel incomplete or shallow, which limits personal growth. Mental health professionals lose potentially valuable context when clients don’t have a clear record of their thought processes. Future selves risk repeating past mistakes or missing lessons that could have been drawn from a better-documented reflection process.  



## Features

### Unclear/Too-Open Academic Tracks (Academic Pathfinding)

**Pathway Builder:** Students can input their interests and long-term goals, and the system generates sample course pathways (including classes, projects, and extracurriculars). This helps students see concrete, structured options rather than vague lists, reducing confusion. Advisors could also use this feature to guide conversations.  

**Experience Reviews:** Upperclassmen and recent graduates can leave reviews of courses, projects, or internships, tagged by skill-building and career relevance. This would give incoming students authentic first-hand insight that complements official advisor input.  

**Advisor-Researcher Dashboard:** A tool where advisors and researchers can see aggregated data on student pathways and skill-building trends. This would help them spot knowledge gaps and suggest more targeted opportunities to their advisees or trainees.  

---

### Difficulty Sharing Personal Faith Experiences (Faith Reflections)

**Anonymous Story Sharing:** Muslim students can share faith-based reflections anonymously, lowering the barrier of vulnerability while still fostering connection. This supports students who may not feel ready to openly attach their identity to their story.  

**Contextual Tagging:** Posts can be tagged with themes like *kindness*, *family*, or *self-discipline*, making it easier for non-Muslim peers to connect with universal values even if they don’t share the same faith. This helps build empathy and shared understanding.  

**Organization Amplification:** Campus cultural/religious organizations can feature selected student stories in newsletters or blogs (with permission). This helps them showcase authentic voices while reducing the burden on students to self-promote.  

---

### Incomplete Reflections (Self-Journaling)

**Decision Journal Template:** A structured form where individuals log not just outcomes but also reasoning, excluded options, and external factors at the time of a decision. This helps their future self—and even therapists—see a complete thought process rather than just results.  

**Timeline View:** Entries are visualized on a timeline, allowing individuals to see how their reasoning evolves over time. This supports reflection by making patterns and changes in thinking more visible.  

**Memory Prompts:** The system occasionally prompts users with contextual questions like “What was your biggest concern at the time?” or “What option did you rule out and why?” This ensures richer documentation that guards against oversimplified memories.

This repository is dedicated to my work for Fall 2025 in the Software Design course.

## About Me
My name is **AlQasem Senegali (Q)**. Iâ€™m a senior at MIT majoring in Computer Science & Engineering.  
My studies have focused on applied math topics and how they can be used to build and enhance AI.  
My career interests mostly lie in education, though Iâ€™m still exploring!

If you ever bump into me, feel free to say hi! Looking for conversation starters? Here are a few:
1. Interesting psychological facts  
2. Anything about education  
3. Ducks, ducks, and more ducks ðŸ¦†
